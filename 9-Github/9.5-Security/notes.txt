Navigate to the settings tab on a repo and then to the code security and analysis tab.
Enable Dependabot, Code Scanning and Secret Scanning. You can then view their suggestions in the security notes.

Dependabot sends you email notifications when there are security risks in your code or outdated dependency versions. It also generates PRs that you can approve to make the changes.
Secret scanning makes sure there arent any exposed secrets in a repo and then blocks commits that contain them
Code scanning offers more suggestions on how to fix possible security risks in your code

It is generally a good idea to have all 3 features enabled on your repos.
