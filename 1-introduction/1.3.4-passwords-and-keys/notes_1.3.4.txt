Password management softwares:

KeePass - manages your passwords for you so you only need to remember one

Lastpass - a step up that incorporates browser extensions and password sharing

1Password - main competitor to Lastpass. Growing popularity rapidly



SSH Key Generation

# Generate SSH keys. Use the default file and empty passphrase for the keys.
ssh-keygen -b 4096

# Copy public key to SSH server
scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub <HOST_NAME>:

# SSH to host
ssh <HOST_NAME>

# Append public key to authorized_keys
mkdir ~/.ssh
cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
rm id_rsa.pub


Instead of running the above key generation, try using the ed25519 algorithm:
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 then copy the file named id_ed25519.pub.
Note that this only works when not using Azure VMs

SSH Permissions

.ssh/ needs a permission level of 0700, and 
.ssh/authorized_keys needs a permission level of 0600 
to authenticate properly. Permissions can be changed 
using the chmod command.


SSH Config Files

# .ssh/config

Host my_host
    Hostname ec2-42-42-42-42.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com
    User ec2-user
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/host_public_key.pub

This can help you SSH without typing a password or needing to navigate to a PEM file


SSH Key exchanges are a little time consuming to set up, but save a lot of
time in the long run. They are more secure, but also can cause more issues should something go wrong.
