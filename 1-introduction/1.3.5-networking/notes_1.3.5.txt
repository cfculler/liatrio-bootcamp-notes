Useful Ports
SSH - port 22
HTTP - 80
HTTPS - port 443


Subnets

Subnets are cool as they add a level of abstraction below the base network, which adds security.
They act as a tradeoff, however, between level of security and allowable traffic.


Exercise
Examine the network your computer is on and try to answer the following questions:

What subnet is your computer on? - 255.255.255.0
How many IP address are available on the subnet? - 255
What is your computers IP address on the subnet?  - 192.168.0.42
How did your computer get assigned that IP address? - dynamically via DHCP
What is your computers public Internet IP address? (hint: google what is my ip) - 98.208.42.143
How does the private subnet IP address of your computer and the public Internet IP address relate to each other?
    "A public IP address identifies you to the wider internet so that all the information you're searching for can find you. 
    A private IP address is used within a private network to connect securely to other devices within that same network."
How does traffic get routed from the Internet to your computer?
    "A router is usually connected between networks to route packets between them"
