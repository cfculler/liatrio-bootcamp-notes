What does "brew leaves" do?
The brew leaves command lists the packages you have downloaded that you can safely remove.
In other words, on a dependency tree, these are the leaves at the end of the branches. Nothing is using it.

Additionally, "brew cleanup" removes old versions of dependencies that are no longer in use.
