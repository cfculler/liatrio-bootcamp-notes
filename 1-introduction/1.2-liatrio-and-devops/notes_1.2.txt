What does Liatrio do?

Liatrio works hard with clients to help with their needs as efficiently as possible.
As discussed in 1.1, we are there to assist with automation, testing, deployment and CI.

"DevOps has revolutionized software development within the last couple decades. 
At the turn of the century, it was common that development teams would work on independent pieces of a project, 
which would ultimately have to be merged and compiled by a tech lead at the end of a project. This led to an 
enormous problem. If code didn't merge together and function as expected, a team might not know until very late 
in the development process, or even until after deploying. Since that time, developers have created processes and 
tools to help build, test, and manage code throughout the life of a project. Those tools and processes help form 
the foundation of what we know today as DevOps."

Devops has helped reduced the need for excessive ensuring of developer consistency. Before, if developers weren't being consistent with each other,
or causing bugs, it would be  nightmare to fix the mistakes when trying to merge. Now, automated testing can ensure each dev's progress is good before ever making it to merge.
